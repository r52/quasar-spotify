[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ms3bgy8srhw3mxm0?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/r52/spotify-quasar)

Spotify API extension and sample widget for Quasar.

This extension mostly implements Spotify's Player API as Quasar Data Sources. See the [Spotify API Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/) for more details.

Since the Spotify API is rate limited for each App, this extension does not provide a Client ID/Secret. [Register your own App](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app) on the Spotify site and set up your Client ID and Secret in Quasar settings.
